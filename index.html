                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                I've been keeping the geblinkenlights geblinking since the early 90s; if it happens in, around, or near a rack I've done it. My skills include: systems administration, back-end systems programming and front-end web applications, database management and RDBS design, source control administration, configuration management, build and release engineering, and plenty more I'm forgetting. I've managed teams, run training, designed and implemented budgets and policy for both IT and Web Operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                I'm allergic to dogma, your favourite programming language is great, and I make a mean cup of coffee.

                products that rock with people that rock but fail anyway because market forces." Also, could it not be advertising?

                <h3>Objective</h3>
                <p>
                I'm looking to put my skills to use working on products and services that matter to people. For the last few years I've really enjoyed full-time
                web application development, but I still got love for the <s>streets</s> sysadmining. I'd prefer to telecommute but will happily come
                in to the office if that's how you roll.

                <!--
                IMG is a CompuGlobalHyperMegaNet in IP licensing. I didn't much care for the company, and it 
                didn't much care for me. But my team was awesome, I loved working with them, and they earned
                my loyalty. I was fortunate to be able to transition out of the IT department when IMG 
                acquired Caustic, because I was most definitely not compatible with IMG's IT group.

                SplutterFish was a start-up that built Brazil r/s, rendering software which in its prime was used by
                the likes of Blizzard, LucasArts and Pixar. The founders gave me a huge break and took a risk giving 
                a young fellow complete control of the company's infrastructure. I practised what would later be called 
                DevOps by young people, and "Isn't That Just How You're Supposed To Do Systems Administration?" by the
                rest of us.

                This was also the beginning of my telecommuting full time, which I've done ever since. That's over a 
                decade of pants-optional programming and sysadmining, to which I attribute my continued success.

                colleagues to collaborate. It was enough to keep me off the dole, but that's about all, and I hated the stress of
                constantly chasing the next contract, the next client. Definitely not built for freelancing, me.
